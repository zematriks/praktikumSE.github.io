    <h2 align="center">Inspired by Uthman ibn Affan</h2>
    <p align="center">Uthman ibn Affan (عثمان بن عفان‎), the third caliph of the Rashidun Caliphate, was a key figure in early Islamic history, particularly for his administrative and spiritual leadership.</p>
    <p align="center">Uthman was known to be a wealthy and generous companion of the Prophet Muhammad, playing more of a supportive role in early Islamic battles rather than being directly involved as a warrior in many of them. While Uthman supported the Islamic cause, his direct involvement in large-scale combat is less emphasized compared to other caliphs, such as Abu Bakr and Umar ibn al-Khattab, or warriors like Khalid ibn al-Walid.

    That said, horses were central to warfare during Uthman's time, as they played a crucial role in the swift movement of armies, delivering messages, and fighting cavalry charges. Although specific instances of Uthman personally engaging in horseback combat are rare in the historical record, his leadership as caliph oversaw many battles in which horses were an integral part of Islamic military strategy.</p>
